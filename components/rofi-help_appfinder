CUSTOMIZATION

Appfinder uses a unique pair of configuration files that are located in ~/.config/rofi/themes/appfinder.

1. mxfb-appfinder-config.rasi: 
--the "window" section sets position and size
--the "color" section sets colors
2. mxfb-appfinder.rasi: 
--sets which tabs are displayed
--imports other settings from the file above.

Both files can be manually edited with a text editor such as Featherpad.
